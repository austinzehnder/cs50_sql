you should write all SQL statements required to replicate your creation of the view. That is:
If creating the view requires creating a separate table and inserting data into it, you should ensure that 
private.sql contains the statements to create that table and insert that data. (Donâ€™t be afraid to add tables 
and add data as you wish!)
private.sql, when run a fresh instance of private.db, should be able to fully reconstruct your view.
